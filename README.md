# Rock-Paper-Scissor-Game

This is a simple Rock Paper Scissors game implemented using C++. The game allows a player to compete against the computer by choosing one of three options: Rock, Paper, or Scissors. The program randomly selects a choice for the computer, and the winner is determined based on the following rules:

Rock beats Scissors
Scissors beats Paper
Paper beats Rock
The game provides the player with the ability to play multiple rounds, and it tracks the score across rounds, displaying the winner after each round. The project demonstrates basic programming concepts such as input handling, conditionals, and random number generation. This game was developed as part of my C++ learning journey, showcasing my ability to create interactive programs.
